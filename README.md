# Benford’s Law on World Bank GDP

This project replicates the analysis from the article **“Benford’s Law in the Wild: Verifying It on World Bank GDP (With Python)”**, showing how the leading digits of GDP follow Benford’s Law. Benford’s Law predicts that in many real‑world datasets, the first digit is not uniformly distributed: 1 appears about 30% of the time, and 9 only about 5%. World Bank GDP (current US$) is a natural testbed because GDP spans several orders of magnitude and is generated by multiplicative economic processes. [web:1]

## 1. Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Packages:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`

Install with: 

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib

## 2. Data

The code expects the World Bank GDP (current US$) series:

- **Indicator**: GDP (current US$)
- **Indicator code**: `NY.GDP.MKTP.CD`
- **Source**: World Development Indicators (World Bank) [web:1]

Download the bulk CSV for this indicator and place it in the project root, e.g.: API_NY.GDP.MKTP.CD_DS2_en_csv_v2.csv


If it’s a notebook (e.g., `benford.ipynb`):

1. Open it in Jupyter or VS Code.
2. Run all cells top to bottom.

### Outputs

- Console prints for:
  - Row counts before/after cleaning.
  - MAD value.
- Plots:
  - Bar chart: Observed vs Benford first‑digit frequencies.
  - (Optional) Line chart: MAD by year.
